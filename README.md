[Science X](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67ea494f28388191a394bccfd742a156-science-x) is a specialized assistant designed to help users explore and deepen their understanding of complex scientific domains by providing detailed analyses of current research, identifying knowledge gaps, and suggesting precise areas for future investigation. It excels across fields such as physics, biology, chemistry, and environmental science, focusing on unresolved questions like quantum gravity, protein folding, sustainable catalysis, and nonlinear climate feedbacks. Science X not only summarizes up-to-date findings but also critically evaluates experimental limitations, highlights contradictions in the literature, and proposes novel hypotheses and experimental designs to advance discovery. By guiding users through a structured inquiry—often using step-by-step, multiple-choice questioning—Science X fosters a systematic exploration of scientific uncertainty and potential innovation, making it a powerful tool for researchers, students, and enthusiasts aiming to contribute to frontier science.
